#How to turn on Netflix with a Roku stick

1. Make sure that the double-pronged television and Roku plugs are plugged into
    the wall
2. If they are not, ask someone old enough (preferably older than 10) to plug
    them in
3. Plug the Roku into the television by placing the rectangular HDMI end of the
    stick into the appropriate outlet on the television (this is usually located
    in the back or on the side of the television). Pay attention to what the
    outlet is labelled as (HDMI1 or HDMI2)
4. Open the back of both remotes and make sure that the appropriate batteries
    (likely AAA) are inside.
5. Turn on the television using the "Power" button on the TV remote (if it does
    not turn on, try pressing the "TV" button then "Power." If this still does
    not turn on, try changing the batteries of the remote)
5. Locate the button that says either "Input" or "Video Source" and press this
    (or you may need to use the arrows toward the top of the remote) until you
    reach the channel with the same name as where you plugged in the Roku stick
6. Using the Roku remote, use the arrows to scroll until Netflix is highlighted
7. Press the middle button to select
8. Scroll until you find a great show (Parks&Rec) or movie (Shrek) and enjoy!
